# Archaeological Data Science

A "day in the life" repository of using data science as an archaeologist...
samples from some of my work projects and experiments (mainly in R). Much of
this work revolves around simple ETL and EDA, summarization and descriptive
statistics, manipulating and summarizing spatial data, and a few more "advanced"
experiments with probability distribution modeling.

The code in this repository is very rough for now. I'll clean them up into
formal scripts as I have time.
